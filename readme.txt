== Frequently Asked Questions ==

The `[wp_post_of_the_day]` shortcode supports a few attributes to give you more control over the results:

* **author** - Provide an author ID or a comma-separated list of author IDs if you want to limit the selected posts to one of those authors. Example: `[wp-post-of-the-day author="1, 11, 14"]`

* **not** - Provide a comma-separated list of post IDs to exclude. Example: `[wp-post-of-the-day not="3, 456, 876"]`

* **post_type** - Provide a post type or a comma-separated list of post types to pull from. You must use the internal post type name. Default is `post`. Example: `[wp-post-of-the-day post_type="page"]`

* **search** - Provide a custom search term to limit the selected posts returned.  Example: `[wp-post-of-the-day search="relativity"]`

* **taxonomy** - Provide a custom taxonomy to pull from. Requires the `terms` attribute to be set as well. Example: `[wp-post-of-the-day taxonomy="post_tag" terms="2,4"]`

* **terms** - Provide a term ID or comma-separated list of term IDs to limit the selected posts returned. Requires the `taxonomy` attribute to be set as well. Example: `[wp-post-of-the-day taxonomy="post_tag" terms="2,4"]`

* **class** - Provide a custom class name for the wrapping HTML div. Example: `[wp-post-of-the-day class="my-custom-class"]`

* **size** - Provide a registered image size to use for image display (optional, only takes effect if images are being shown). Example: `[wp-post-of-the-day size="thumbnail"]`

* **show** - Provide a comma-separated list of post elements to display. You can also use a vertical pipe `|` character instead of a comma to separate items into columns. Options are: title, image, excerpt, content. Defaults to `title, image, excerpt`. Items will show in the order you provide. Note: If images are shown, only posts with featured images will be returned. Example: `[wp-post-of-the-day show="title, image"]`

Keep in mind that any of these attributes can be combined as needed.  Example: `[wp-post-of-the-day author="19" size="full" not="2310"]`.  Also, keep in mind that the shortcode can be used in text widgets.
